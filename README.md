# @openclaw/1password

OpenClaw plugin for 1Password secrets. Uses the official JavaScript SDK with service accounts for fully headless operation — no desktop app, no biometrics, no popups.

## What It Does

1. **Resolves `op://` references in `openclaw.json` at startup** — Replace plaintext API keys with `op://Agent Secrets/Item/field` references. The plugin resolves them to real values in memory when OpenClaw boots. The plaintext key never touches disk.

2. **Gives agents tools to read and write secrets on demand** — Agents call `op_read_secret` to pull a key from 1Password at runtime, `op_list_items` to discover what's available, or `op_write_secret` to store new credentials.

3. **CLI for diagnostics** — `openclaw op-secrets test` verifies 1Password connectivity. `openclaw op-secrets read` shows a redacted preview of any secret.

## Limitations

- **`auth-profiles.json` cannot use `op://` refs.** This file is loaded by a separate OpenClaw subsystem that the plugin can't hook into. Auth provider tokens (Anthropic, OpenAI OAuth) must remain as real values in that file. The resolver service only handles `openclaw.json` (the main config passed to plugins via `ctx.config`).

- **`op_write_secret` requires `write_items` permission** on the service account. The default setup uses `read_items` only. See [Write Support](#write-support) for setup.

- **Secrets are resolved in memory only.** If OpenClaw reloads config from disk mid-session, `op://` refs need to be resolved again. The service runs at startup, so this is fine for normal operation.

## Prerequisites

- **1Password Business or Teams plan** (required for service accounts)
- **Node.js 18+**
- **OpenClaw** 2026.1+

## Quick Start

### 1. Install the plugin

```bash
openclaw plugins install @openclaw/1password
```

### 2. Set up 1Password

Create a custom vault and service account (service accounts can't access built-in vaults):

```bash
# Create a vault for agent secrets
op vault create "Agent Secrets"

# Add your API keys
op item create --category "API Credential" --title "OpenAI API" \
  --vault "Agent Secrets" 'api key=YOUR_KEY_HERE'

# Create a read-only service account
op service-account create "OpenClaw Agent" \
  --expires-in 0 \
  --vault "Agent Secrets:read_items"
```

### 3. Save the service account token

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.openclaw/secrets
# Save the ops_... token from step 2 into this file:
echo "ops_..." > ~/.openclaw/secrets/op-sa-token
chmod 600 ~/.openclaw/secrets/op-sa-token
```

### 4. Enable the plugin

Add to `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`:

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "entries": {
      "op-secrets": {
        "enabled": true,
        "config": {
          "defaultVault": "Agent Secrets"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Note:** The config key must be `op-secrets` (matching the plugin manifest `id`), not `1password`.

### 5. Test

```bash
openclaw op-secrets test
```

### 6. Using `op://` references in config

The plugin resolves `op://vault/item/field` strings in `openclaw.json` at startup. The real key never appears on disk.

**Example: a custom config field**
```json
{
  "someService": {
    "apiKey": "op://Agent Secrets/Some Service/api key"
  }
}
```

**Important: OpenAI API key for memory search**

Do **NOT** put an `apiKey` in `memorySearch.remote`. OpenClaw's `resolveOpenAiEmbeddingClient()` checks `remote.apiKey` first — if any value exists (even an `op://` reference), it uses it directly and **never** falls through to the env var. Instead, leave `"remote": {}` empty. The plugin resolves the OpenAI key from 1Password and sets `process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY` at startup; memory search picks it up from the env var.

```jsonc
// CORRECT — env var fallback works
"memorySearch": { "remote": {} }

// WRONG — blocks the env var fallback, key never resolves
"memorySearch": { "remote": { "apiKey": "op://Agent Secrets/OpenAI API/api key" } }
```

**Note:** `op://` resolution only works for `openclaw.json`. Auth profile tokens in `auth-profiles.json` cannot use `op://` refs — see [Limitations](#limitations).

## Agent Tools

### `op_read_secret`

Reads a secret value from 1Password. Agents call this tool when they need an API key or credential.

| Parameter | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `item` | Yes | — | Item title (e.g. "OpenAI API") |
| `vault` | No | Config default | Vault name |
| `field` | No | `"api key"` | Field name |

### `op_list_items`

Lists all items in a vault so agents can discover available secrets.

| Parameter | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `vault` | No | Config default | Vault name |

### `op_write_secret`

Creates or updates a secret in 1Password. Requires `write_items` permission on the service account.

| Parameter | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `item` | Yes | — | Item title (e.g. "New API Key") |
| `value` | Yes | — | The secret value to store |
| `vault` | No | Config default | Vault name |
| `field` | No | `"api key"` | Field name |

All tools are registered as **optional** and must be allowlisted in agent config to use.

## Config Secret Resolution

The plugin registers a startup service that walks `openclaw.json` and resolves any string matching `op://vault/item/field` to its real value via the 1Password SDK. Resolution happens in memory — the file on disk keeps the `op://` reference.

The `resolveSecretRefs` utility is also exported for programmatic use:

```typescript
import { resolveSecretRefs } from "@openclaw/1password";

const resolved = await resolveSecretRefs({
  apiKey: "op://Agent Secrets/OpenAI API/api key",
  other: "not a secret, passed through",
});
// resolved.apiKey === "sk-proj-..."
// resolved.other === "not a secret, passed through"
```

## CLI Commands

```bash
# Verify 1Password connectivity
openclaw op-secrets test

# Read a secret (shows redacted preview, safe for terminals)
openclaw op-secrets read "OpenAI API"
openclaw op-secrets read "Anthropic Auth Token" --vault "Agent Secrets"
openclaw op-secrets read "DB Password" --field "password"

# Dry-run: show which op:// refs would be resolved in a JSON file
openclaw op-secrets resolve ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json
```

## Write Support

To enable write operations (`op_write_secret`), the service account needs `write_items` permission:

```bash
op service-account create "OpenClaw Agent" \
  --expires-in 0 \
  --vault "Agent Secrets:read_items,write_items"
```

Then update the token at `~/.openclaw/secrets/op-sa-token`.

## Configuration

Plugin config in `openclaw.json` under `plugins.entries.op-secrets.config`:

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `defaultVault` | string | `"Agent Secrets"` | Default vault for tool calls |
| `tokenPath` | string | `~/.openclaw/secrets/op-sa-token` | Path to service account token file |

The token path can also be set via the `OP_SA_TOKEN_PATH` environment variable.

## How It Works

1. On plugin load, the resolver service walks `openclaw.json` and resolves `op://` references in memory
2. On first secret request, the plugin reads the service account token from disk
3. It creates a 1Password SDK client (cached for the session lifetime)
4. Secrets are resolved via `client.secrets.resolve("op://Vault/Item/field")`
5. The SDK talks directly to 1Password's servers over HTTPS
6. Secret values exist in memory only — never written to disk or logs

The service account token does not expire (unless you set `--expires-in`). It survives reboots. No desktop app needed.

## Security

- Service account tokens grant access only to specific vaults you configure
- The token file is `chmod 600` — only the owning user can read it
- Secret values are never logged, cached, or written to disk by the plugin
- The SKILL.md file instructs agents to never echo or log returned secrets
- If a secret is exposed, rotate it in 1Password — the plugin always reads the current value
- `op://` references in config files are safe to commit to version control

## Troubleshooting

**"Token file not found"** — Make sure `~/.openclaw/secrets/op-sa-token` exists and contains your `ops_...` token.

**"Vault not found"** — Service accounts can only access custom vaults, not built-in ones (Shared, Employee, Private). Create a custom vault and grant access.

**"403 Forbidden" when creating service account** — Enable "Developer" / "Secrets Automation" in your 1Password admin console under Settings.

**"Granting a service account access to the Team/Shared vault is not supported"** — Use a custom vault name, not the built-in "Shared" vault.

**Write operations fail** — The service account needs `write_items` permission. See [Write Support](#write-support).

## Developer Guide: Using 1Password in Your Own Projects

This section covers how to use 1Password secrets in new OpenClaw plugins, MCP servers, standalone scripts, or any Node.js project that needs secrets from the same vault.

### Option 1: Use the `op` CLI (simplest, any language)

Shell out to the `op` CLI with the service account token. This is what lesa-bridge uses.

```typescript
import { execSync } from "node:child_process";
import { readFileSync } from "node:fs";

const saToken = readFileSync(
  `${process.env.HOME}/.openclaw/secrets/op-sa-token`,
  "utf-8"
).trim();

const apiKey = execSync(
  `op read "op://Agent Secrets/OpenAI API/api key"`,
  {
    env: { ...process.env, OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN: saToken },
    encoding: "utf-8",
    timeout: 10000,
  }
).trim();
```

**Pros:** No native dependencies, works in any language, one-liner per secret.
**Cons:** Requires `op` CLI installed (`brew install 1password-cli`), subprocess overhead.

### Option 2: Use the 1Password JS SDK (this plugin's approach)

```typescript
import { createClient } from "@1password/sdk";
import { readFileSync } from "node:fs";

const token = readFileSync(
  `${process.env.HOME}/.openclaw/secrets/op-sa-token`,
  "utf-8"
).trim();

const client = await createClient({
  auth: token,
  integrationName: "MyProject",
  integrationVersion: "0.1.0",
});

// Resolve a secret
const apiKey = await client.secrets.resolve(
  "op://Agent Secrets/OpenAI API/api key"
);

// List vaults
const vaults = await client.vaults.list();

// List items in a vault
const items = await client.items.list(vaultId);
```

**Pros:** No subprocess, faster, full API (list/create/update items).
**Cons:** Native dependency (`@1password/sdk`), larger install footprint.

### Option 3: Use the plugin's tools at runtime (OpenClaw agents only)

If your code runs as an OpenClaw agent or plugin, call the existing `op_read_secret` tool:

```
op_read_secret({ item: "OpenAI API", vault: "Agent Secrets", field: "api key" })
```

No code needed — the tool is already registered by this plugin.

### Patterns for Common Scenarios

**Resolve a key at startup, cache it:**
```typescript
let cachedKey: string | null = null;

function getApiKey(): string {
  if (cachedKey) return cachedKey;
  cachedKey = execSync(`op read "op://Agent Secrets/MyService/api key"`, {
    env: { ...process.env, OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN: saToken },
    encoding: "utf-8",
    timeout: 10000,
  }).trim();
  return cachedKey;
}
```

**Set as environment variable (for libraries that read `process.env`):**
```typescript
process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY = await client.secrets.resolve(
  "op://Agent Secrets/OpenAI API/api key"
);
// Now any library that checks process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY will find it
```

**Store a new secret (requires write_items permission):**
```typescript
await client.items.create({
  vaultId: "vault-uuid",
  title: "New API Key",
  category: ItemCategory.ApiCredential,
  fields: [
    {
      id: "api_key",
      title: "api key",
      value: "sk-proj-...",
      fieldType: ItemFieldType.Concealed,
    },
  ],
});
```

### Key Rules

1. **Never hardcode secrets.** Use `op://` references in config, resolve at runtime.
2. **Never log secrets.** Use the `redact()` helper for debug output.
3. **Cache the client.** Creating a 1Password SDK client is expensive (~200ms). Create once, reuse.
4. **Cache resolved values.** Secrets don't change mid-session. Resolve once at startup.
5. **Service account token location:** Always `~/.openclaw/secrets/op-sa-token`. Don't invent new paths.
6. **Vault name:** `Agent Secrets` is the shared vault. Add items there unless you need isolation.
7. **Item naming:** Use descriptive titles like `"OpenAI API"`, `"GitHub Token"`. Only alphanumeric, `_`, `.`, `-` characters.
8. **SA permissions are immutable.** If you need `write_items` and the current SA only has `read_items`, you must create a new service account.

### Adding a New Secret

```bash
# Via op CLI
OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN=$(cat ~/.openclaw/secrets/op-sa-token) \
  op item create --category "API Credential" --title "My New Service" \
  --vault "Agent Secrets" 'api key=YOUR_KEY_HERE'

# Verify
OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN=$(cat ~/.openclaw/secrets/op-sa-token) \
  op read "op://Agent Secrets/My New Service/api key"
```

### Example Projects Using 1Password

| Project | How it uses 1Password |
|---------|----------------------|
| `openclaw-1password` (this) | JS SDK, startup resolver, agent tools |
| `lesa-bridge` | `op` CLI, resolves OpenAI key at MCP server startup |
| `openclaw-context-embeddings` | Reads `process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY` (set by this plugin at boot) |
